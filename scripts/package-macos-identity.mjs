/**
 * macOS packaging entry point with an independently identified Electron.
 *
 * Every macOS package lane in this repository replaces the plain
 * `electron-builder` invocation with this wrapper, so one place assembles the
 * independent distribution (see `scripts/assemble-electron-dist.mjs`) and one
 * place installs the pre-sign identity gate (see `scripts/macos-identity-gate.mjs`).
 * Because both flags are added here, the *only* macOS package path that can reach
 * electron-builder is one that carries them; there is no fallback to the stock
 * Electron distribution, whose main executable UUID collides with the official
 * application and costs this app its Local Network identity (ADR plus-independent-application-identity).
 *
 * Two failure modes are guarded explicitly, both observed while wiring this up:
 * a bare `--` forwarded by `pnpm run <script> -- <args>` makes electron-builder's
 * option parser ignore every flag after it, and electron-builder still exits
 * successfully when an `afterPack` hook or an `electronDist` override is silently
 * ineffective. So the separator is dropped here, the flags are placed before the
 * caller's arguments, and the packaged bundles are verified afterwards.
 *
 * A caller that already assembled a distribution may pass `PI_ELECTRON_DIST` to
 * skip the assembly step.
 *
 * Non-macOS hosts are passed straight through to electron-builder with the
 * arguments the caller gave, so the Windows and Linux lanes behave exactly as
 * before.
 *
 * Usage (from any macOS lane): `node ../../scripts/package-macos-identity.mjs --mac --publish never`
