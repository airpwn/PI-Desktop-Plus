# ADR: Independent Pi-Desktop-Plus Application Identity

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-26
- Amends for this fork: ADR 0278, ADR 0094, ADR 0204

## Context

The initial branding patch mixed Pi-Desktop-Plus copy with PI-Desktop package
identity, data roots, and update sources. Its macOS helper could not open the
generated bundle, existing development caches could prevent launch, and the
release checks disagreed with artifact names. Changing only the display name
would also create separate Electron locks over the same host database.

The user authorized the independent-install plan. Existing PI-Desktop data
and installations must remain intact; this is not an in-place upgrade.

## Decision

- The product name is `Pi-Desktop-Plus`, production ID is
  `cn.sakura.pi-desktop`, and macOS development ID adds `.dev`.
- Electron profiles use `Pi-Desktop-Plus` and `Pi-Desktop-Plus Dev`. Host data
  defaults to `~/.pi-desktop-plus` or `~/.pi-desktop-plus-dev` for desktop
  development. Explicit profile/data overrides retain their existing meaning.
- Standalone host-core and pi-host use the Plus data root. SSH-installed
  pi-host binaries, bootstrap state, logs and pidfile live under
  `~/.pi-desktop-plus/pi-host`; remote host data uses the parent Plus root.
- Windows executable/shortcut and macOS bundle names use the product name.
  Linux package, executable, desktop and icon identifiers use `pi-desktop-plus`.
- Release metadata, update links, remote-host artifacts and issue URLs use
  `SakuraLoveSmile/PI-Desktop`. There is no upstream binary-feed fallback.
- Packaged metadata uses `name=pi-desktop-plus`, giving electron-updater its
  own `pi-desktop-plus-updater` cache instead of the old product cache.
- Signed macOS releases require the fork operator's explicit identity and
  team configuration. Missing credentials or signature/team mismatches fail
  the signed lane. Unsigned local builds do not require signing credentials.
- Each supported macOS architecture must carry a Plus main-executable UUID
  distinct from the stock Electron input and from the official PI-Desktop app.
  The identity change happens while the candidate is constructed, before final
  signing; an installed or already signed bundle is never patched.
- The selected supported route is an independently linked Electron main
  executable supplied to electron-builder through `electronDist`. Rewriting
  `LC_UUID` in a signed bundle, an `afterSign` hook that alters binary bytes, an
  Electron version change to obtain a different UUID, and a native launcher
  rewrite are all excluded.
- Existing profiles are neither imported, moved nor deleted. Protocol names,
  package module names, database schema and Plugin SDK contracts stay stable.

## Alternatives

An in-place rename preserving the old app ID and data roots would retain an
upgrade chain but would not provide independent installations. It was not
selected. Automatically copying profiles would introduce credential and
database migration risks beyond the requested rename.

## Consequences

Plus starts with fresh data and fresh OS permissions. Old installations can
coexist, but explicitly pointing both products at the same data directory is
still an operator override, not a supported concurrent-write arrangement.
The fork needs its own release artifacts and signing credentials before a
signed release can be qualified. Source tests and unsigned builds do not
prove notarization, native Windows/Linux acceptance, or live update delivery.

## Identity qualification record (2026-09-30)

Apple TN3178 documents network-subsystem confusion when differently identified
applications reuse a main executable UUID, and TN3179 states that Local Network
identity uses code signing together with the main executable UUID. Read-only
inspection of the installed bundles found both installed main executables
reporting the same arm64 UUID, while the Plus bundle carries its own
`cn.sakura.pi-desktop` identifier, product name, `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`
and a valid Apple Development signature. That qualifies the *signature* and
*identifier* facts only. It does not prove causality for any Local Network
failure: no packet capture, HTTP response, native alert or settings entry was
observed for the current candidate, and the earlier September evidence concerned
a different build.

`scripts/macos-executable-identity.mjs` is the read-only qualification gate for
candidate and input paths. Per architecture slice it reports a missing UUID, a
wrong application identifier, a duplicate main-executable UUID against a supplied
reference, a missing or failing signature, or a qualified independent identity,
and it checks `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` presence. UUIDs belonging to
libraries are informational: only the main executable's UUID decides the
collision verdict. The verifier never writes, signs or patches anything, and it
reports a signature category rather than a signing-authority string.

The pinned Electron release is consumed from an independently assembled
distribution rather than from `node_modules` directly:
`scripts/assemble-electron-dist.mjs` links
`apps/desktop/build/electron-main-stub.c` against the official framework, and
`scripts/package-macos-identity.mjs` installs that distribution together with the
pre-sign gate `scripts/macos-identity-gate.mjs` into every macOS package lane. The
read-only feasibility probe had recorded why a full source build was unavailable
on the build host (no checkout, no GN/Ninja); the relink route needs neither.

## Relinked main executable and pre-sign gate (2026-10-01)

The route described above was replaced by a cheaper one that satisfies the same
decision, after measurement showed why the obvious shortcuts cannot work:

- electron-builder renames Electron's prebuilt main executable and never relinks
  it (`app-builder-lib/out/electron/electronMac.js` -> `doRename(...)`).
- Chromium links with LLD, whose `LC_UUID` is derived from the linked content, so
  rebuilding the same stub would reproduce the same UUID. The installed official
  application and the stock Electron distribution both report the main executable
  UUID `4C4C44B6-5555-3144-A187-35A40BAD7A39`, and nine library UUIDs match too.
- Patching `LC_UUID` in a signed bundle, an `afterSign` hook that rewrites bytes,
  and an Electron version change to obtain a different UUID all remain excluded.

`apps/desktop/build/electron-main-stub.c` therefore reproduces the upstream
`main()` for the macOS browser process at tag `v43.6.0` and is compiled here
against the pinned framework; Apple's `ld` gives the result a fresh UUID.
`Electron Framework`, the helper applications, the resources and the `version`
file are reused verbatim, so no Electron version changes. Two deliberate
deviations from upstream are recorded in that file: the helper-executable
seatbelt branch is not reproduced, and the `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` fuse gate is
replaced by honouring the variable whenever it is set (the fuse is enabled in
official builds and this repository does not flip it).

Measured before and after on one machine, with the same unsigned packaging lane,
so the main executable UUID is the only changed variable:

| Observation | Shared UUID | Relinked UUID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local Network prompt | never shown | shown |
| System Settings -> Local Network entries | `PI-Desktop` only | `Pi-Desktop-Plus` appears |
| LAN request to the local gateway | 29 of 29 failed `net::ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE` | real HTTP response (`401`) |

That is direct evidence that the shared main executable UUID caused the failure,
and it confirms Apple TN3179's model for this case. It does not depend on a
pristine privacy state, because a new identity has no recorded choice.

Consequences: the framework and helper UUIDs stay shared with the official
application (only the main executable is relinked; whether those other UUIDs
matter is unverified), the stub must be revisited when Electron's `main()` or its
fuses change, and a macOS build now needs a working `clang` toolchain in addition
to the packaged sidecar. The pre-sign gate also fails a candidate whose host
sidecar is missing, because electron-builder only warns when an `extraResources`
source does not exist and otherwise ships a `host unavailable` application.

Two packaging hazards surfaced while making this route work, both now guarded:

- Copying the official distribution with Node's `fs.cpSync` rewrote the
  framework's relative symlinks into absolute links pointing back into the package
  store. The framework's root contents then lay outside the bundle and codesign
  refused it with `unsealed contents present in the bundle root`. The assembler
  copies with `ditto` and asserts that the root links stay relative.
- Local lanes sign without a secure timestamp (`-c.mac.timestamp=none`). Asking for
  one makes codesign request a token from Apple's timestamp authority for every
  signed file, and on the development host that token is reproducibly lost partway
  through a build — one failure in roughly every 24 requests, with the failing file
  differing per run — which aborts packaging with `A timestamp was expected but was
  not found`. The release lane keeps the timestamp, because notarization requires
  it, and `PI_MAC_SECURE_TIMESTAMP=1` restores it for a local build that must be
  notarized.
